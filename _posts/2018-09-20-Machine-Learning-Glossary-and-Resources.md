# Machine Learning Glossary and Resources!

_Encyclopedia Machina_

## Overview

Machine Learning, as an area of focus in computer and data science, has a _lot_ of jargon that can send you down rabbit holes. It's definitely happened to me! So, with that in mind, I'm creating a directory of common terms, resources for extra learning, and my two cents on whether it's worth diving down that rabbit hole to know more.

## TLDR/Getting starting with ML as a concept

I don't have a lot of time to read: check out David Fumo's intro to different ML algorithms [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-953a08248861).

I have _some_ time to read: 

- Adam Geitgey has a knack for making ML relatable, check out his [articles](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471).

I've got all the time to learn at my own pace:

- Udacity has an [Intro to ML course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) that incorporates videos and relatable examples. _Word of advice, you may want to consider skipping through Chapters 1 & 2 unless you like lots of videos and clicking icons._

## Gimme all the terms!
