## Overview

Machine Learning(ML), as an area of focus in computer and data science, has a _lot_ of jargon that can send you down rabbit holes. It's definitely happened to me! So, with that in mind, I'm creating a directory of common terms, resources for extra learning, open source libraries that I've used and for what purpose, and my two cents on whether it's worth diving down that rabbit hole to know more.

## TLDR/Getting starting with ML as a concept

*I don't have a lot of time to read:* check out David Fumo's intro to different ML algorithms [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/types-of-machine-learning-algorithms-you-should-know-953a08248861).

*I have _some_ time to read:* 

- Adam Geitgey has a knack for making ML relatable, check out his [articles](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-80ea3ec3c471).

*I've got all the time to learn at my own pace:*

- Udacity has an [Intro to ML course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) that incorporates videos and relatable examples. _Word of advice, you may want to consider skipping through Chapters 1 & 2 unless you like lots of videos and clicking icons._

## Gimme all the terms!

* Supervised Learning
* Unsupervised Learning
* Training set
* Model
* Corpus
* On Hot Encoding

## Libraries! I want them all!

*For the command line*

* csvkit: a set of tools that are great for doing some csv munging or file-level changes on the command line.
* pandas: I've used this mostly for one hot encoding
* numpy: 
* scikit-learn:

## I want to start learning ML but I don't know what data I should study

Welcome to ze place for inspiration!

* [r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)
* [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
* [Google's Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch) *Note* They mention it's in beta, and for a reason. Most results are academic in origin
* [Chicago's Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org) This is a new service created by the City of Chicago in an effort to be more transparent. See what you can find!
* [Make a FOIA request!](https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html) *Note* I wouldn't do this unless:
	- You can't find this data anywhere
	- You have time on your hands to wait for the results (especially if from the Fed gov't)
	- You're prepared to sue for this information (which is your right if you do not receive a response within a certain amount of time)
