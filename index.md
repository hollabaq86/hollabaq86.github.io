**Braintree Client and Server SDKs**
At my day job, I'm a Group Tech Lead for [Braintree SDKs]([url](https://github.com/braintree)). This means most of my work is reviewing others' code at this point, but notable historic contributions include implementing support for 3DS v2 in our client SDKs and major version updates to our server SDKs.
